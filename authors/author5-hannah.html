        <h1>Hannah Mae P. yecyec</h1>
        <h2>Content creator & designer</h2>

       <p>Hannah Mae P. Yecyec is an aspiring first-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at Bukidnon State University, where she continues to build a strong academic and creative foundation. Driven by curiosity, innovation, and a passion for lifelong learning, she has already distinguished herself as both a scholar and a versatile young leader.</p>
       <p>Born and raised in Managok, Malaybalay City, Hannah is the second daughter in a family of three sisters. Growing up in a close-knit and supportive household—with her 19-year-old older sister and 5-year-old younger sister—she draws inspiration from her family’s encouragement, which has shaped her discipline, ambition, and dedication to excellence.</p>
       <p>Throughout her educational journey, Hannah has shown exceptional academic consistency. She graduated with honors in elementary, earned high honors in junior high school, and continued to achieve high honors in senior high school. Her academic achievements reflect her strong work ethic, focus, and determination—qualities she now channels into her growing interest in information technology, particularly in software development, digital design, and data-driven solutions.</p>
       <p>Beyond academics, Hannah has established herself as a multi-talented student. She represented her batch in slogan-making and poster-making contests from elementary to senior high school, regularly winning at the school level and gaining recognition for her artistic talent and originality. Her strategic mindset also flourished in competitive chess, where she represented both her batch and her school in district and division tournaments in the female category. These experiences strengthened her resilience, patience, and critical thinking—skills she continues to value in her academic life.</p>
       <p>Hannah’s journey in campus journalism began early. In elementary, she worked as a copy reader and headline writer, roles that sharpened her attention to detail, language skills, and editorial awareness. In high school, she transitioned into layout design for collaborative desktop publishing, blending artistry with technical skill. These experiences not only broadened her creative capabilities but also fostered teamwork, adaptability, and the ability to perform under pressure.</p>
       <p>Her leadership qualities further developed through student government involvement. Hannah served as secretary of both the Supreme Pupil Government (SPG) in elementary and the Supreme Secondary Learner Government (SSLG) in high school. In these roles, she helped facilitate student initiatives, organize events, and support her fellow learners—strengthening her organizational and communication skills.</p>
       <p>As a STEM student in senior high school, she joined various academic competitions and quiz bees that enhanced her analytical and problem-solving abilities. Her STEM background became a stepping stone to her current pursuit in information technology, equipping her with a solid understanding of research, mathematics, and scientific inquiry.</p>
       <p>Hannah also completed a work immersion with an engineering company, where she gained valuable exposure to professional settings. There, she learned the significance of teamwork, punctuality, effective communication, and workplace ethics—all of which deepened her readiness for college and future career opportunities.</p>
       <p>Today, as she takes her first steps into the IT field, Hannah is not only committed to her academic growth but also to contributing meaningfully to her community. She currently shares her voice, creativity, and insights as a an author of “Saka ta Bukidnon,” a platform dedicated to showcasing the culture, stories, destinations, and local pride of the province. Through her writing, she combines her journalistic background, love for Bukidnon, and developing digital skills to promote appreciation for local heritage while honing her craft as a storyteller and aspiring IT professional.</p>
       <p>With a strong foundation of academic excellence, artistic talent, leadership experience, and a passion for community storytelling, Hannah Mae P. Yecyec is poised to build a meaningful and impactful career in the digital era—one grounded in creativity, service, and continuous growth.</p>
